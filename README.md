## Objective

The primary objective of the React Quality Assurance Initiative is to establish and maintain a set of quality standards for our React JS projects. By adhering to these standards, we aim to improve code readability, enforce consistent naming conventions, maintain coding standards, and enhance our development workflow using the Next.js 13 app directory structure.

## Key Points

- **Readability:** Focus on writing clean, well-structured code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Coding Standards:** Adhere to React community guidelines and best practices for component lifecycle methods, hooks, and code organization.
- **Editor Config:** Utilize a shared editor configuration file, such as `.vscode` or `.editorconfig`, to enforce consistent code formatting across the team.

## Getting Started

To get started with the React Quality Assurance Initiative, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Tools and Configuration

The following tools and configurations are recommended for the React Quality Assurance Initiative:

- **VSCode:** Share recommended VSCode settings and extensions for a consistent development experience.
- **ESLint:** Configure ESLint with appropriate rules to enforce code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier:** Set up Prettier for code formatting and integration with ESLint.
- **Husky and Lint-staged:** Utilize Husky and Lint-staged to run pre-commit hooks and enforce linting and formatting checks.
- **Node Custom Script:** Create custom scripts, Only if needed, to automate specific tasks related to code quality.

## Documentation
Well-documented code is essential for collaboration and future maintenance. Consider the following documentation practices:
- Document complex code sections, architectural decisions, and usage instructions inside the doc directory in **Markdown**.
- Maintain a **[initiative].md** file, providing an overview, and specific details.

## Contributing
